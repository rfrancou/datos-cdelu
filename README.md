**DatosCdelu** emerges as a tool to use the information provided by the government of Concepcion del Uruguay. On the website of the government is exposed information on how the public administration of the same city is done, the problem is that this information is not good format and difficult to understand for any ordinary person.

**DatosCdelu** is responsible for solving this problem by offering the same data consumption in a much more structured, simple and easy to access format. All this through a REST API, this is responsible for obtaining these unstructured data in real time and producing a response of these data in a structured format.
